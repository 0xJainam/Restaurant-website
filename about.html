        <h2>More Than a Restaurant, We're a Family Passion.</h2>
        <p>
            Salt & Saffron was born from a simple dream: to create a special place in Mumbai where friends and family could gather to enjoy exceptional food made with love. Our founder and head chef, Jainam, grew up inspired by the vibrant flavors of Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
            After training in kitchens across the world, Chef Jainam returned home with a vision to blend global techniques with the traditional recipes of our region.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Philosophy: Farm-to-Table Freshness</h3>

            We are passionate about ingredients. We believe the best food starts with the best produce, which is why we partner with local farmers,and artisans. Our menu changes with the seasons to reflect what is freshest and most flavorful. This commitment to quality is at the heart of every dish we create, ensuring a truly authentic and memorable dining experience for you.
